**Describe the bug**
Describe what you see that (you think) is wrong.

**Expected behavior**
Describe what you would have expected or think is correct.

**Screenshots**
If useful, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**To Reproduce**
Attach a self contained example that allows us to reproduce the problem.
Such an example typically exist of some source code (can be dummy code), after you verified the example demonstrates the problem, put it in a zip (or tarball) and attach it to the bug report. Try to avoid linking to external sources, since they might disappear in the future.

**Version**
Mention the version of concord used (or if unknown provide the top commit hash from `git log`), and the platform on which you run concord (e.g. Windows 10, 64 bit). If you run concord under Linux please also mention the name and version of the distribution used (output of `lsb_release -a`).  

**Stack trace**
If you encounter a crash and can build concord from sources yourself with a debugger such as `gdb`, a stack trace can be very helpful (especially if it is not possible to capture the problem in a small example that can be shared). If you opt to use `gdb` you can obtain the backtrack leading to the crash by running `bt` from the gdb environment after the crash has occurred.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
